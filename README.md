**Minimizing Economic Cost for Power Systems with  Distinct Startup Times and Costs

*Abstract*: There many forms of power plant types in many different configurations that can be implemented in 
grid design. This paper is meant to show an optimization method for steam, combined cycle and gas 
turbines to meet the system demands of the ISO (Independent System Operator). Here, the amount the 
minimum and maximum a unit can produce, cost of fuel, grid demand, and distinct hot, warm, and cold 
start-up times and cost will be considered. In order to highlight the methods associated with the distinct 
hot, warm, cold start-up times the network grid losses, and impedance of the system will be neglected.
